## 🧠 **Project Title:** Psychopathic Tendencies Finder

### 📘 **Project Description**

The **Psychopathic Tendencies Finder** is a **Java console-based self-assessment program** designed to help users reflect on certain personality traits often associated with psychopathy — such as impulsivity, empathy, manipulativeness, and risk-taking behavior.

It presents users with a series of **12 statements**, inspired by well-known psychological research tools (like the *Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale*), and asks them to rate each statement on a **scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree)**.

At the end of the assessment, the program calculates the **total score** and categorizes the result into three levels:

* **Low psychopathic traits** — reflects empathy, emotional depth, and social responsibility.
* **Moderate psychopathic traits** — indicates occasional impulsive or manipulative tendencies but generally balanced.
* **High psychopathic traits** — suggests a strong presence of traits linked to psychopathy-like behavior; not a diagnosis, but encourages reflection and, if necessary, consultation with a mental health professional.


### ⚙️ **Features**

✅ Console-based interactive questionnaire
✅ Input validation for user-friendly experience
✅ Total score calculation and interpretation
✅ Educational — not diagnostic
✅ Easy to extend (save results, add GUI, or connect to database)


### 🧩 **Technologies Used**

* **Language:** Java
* **Concepts Used:** Loops, Conditionals, Arrays, User Input (Scanner), Basic OOP


### 💡 **How It Works**

1. The program displays 12 psychological statements.
2. The user rates each statement from 1–5.
3. The program sums up all ratings to calculate a **total score out of 60**.
4. The result is interpreted into one of three personality ranges.


### 🚀 **How to Run**

1. Save the file as `PsychopathicTendenciesFinder.java`
2. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   javac PsychopathicTendenciesFinder.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
